Python Summer Party Challenges
This repository contains my solutions to the "Python Summer Party" 15-day coding challenge, hosted by Interview Master and DataCamp. The challenges are designed to help data professionals practice their Python skills with real-world problems inspired by well-known companies.

Challenge 1: WhatsApp (Level: Easy)
Problem: This challenge will help WhatsApp understand group sizes and engagement patterns, which can inform product decisions around group messaging features.

Challenge 2: Amazon (Level: Medium)
Problem: help the Amazon Sponsored Advertising team understand which electronics-related categories are performing well and by how much they outperform the average. This insight is crucial for optimizing targeted advertising strategies to boost engagement.

Challenge 3: Disney (Level: Hard)
Problem: This hard-level problem, inspired by Disney, was a test of advanced Python skills. It required [briefly describe the task, e.g., "a recursive function," "optimizing for performance with large datasets," or "implementing a more complex data structure"]. The notebook contains my thought process and the final optimized code.

Challenge 4: Google (Level: Easy)
Problem: This Google-themed challenge is a great way to reinforce basic Python knowledge. My solution tackles the problem of [briefly describe the task, e.g., "data cleaning and transformation," "filtering a list based on a condition," or "creating a function to format data"].

Challenge 5: Nintendo (Level: Hard)
Problem: A challenging problem based on Nintendo's data. This notebook addresses [briefly describe the task, e.g., "a data analysis task involving time series data," "a complex problem with multiple constraints," or "an advanced algorithm challenge"]. The solution demonstrates a robust approach to solving difficult problems.

Challenge 6: Ben & Jerry's (Level: Hard)
Problem: The Ben & Jerry's challenge was another hard-level problem that [briefly describe the task, e.g., "involved working with text data," "required a complex data aggregation," or "focused on object-oriented programming concepts"]. This solution provides a detailed walkthrough of the problem-solving process.

Challenge 7: Nike (Level: Easy)
Problem: This easy-level challenge from Nike focuses on [briefly describe the task, e.g., "basic list manipulation," "string methods," or "conditional logic"]. It's a quick and effective way to practice fundamental Python syntax.

Challenge 8: Lululemon (Level: Medium)
Problem: This medium-level challenge inspired by Lululemon required [briefly describe the task, e.g., "using pandas for data filtering and sorting," "building a simple data processing pipeline," or "implementing a solution using a dictionary"]. My solution showcases an efficient way to handle this kind of problem.

Challenge 9: Meta (Level: Medium)
Problem: The Meta challenge presented a medium-level problem that involved [briefly describe the task, e.g., "analyzing social media data," "working with JSON files," or "applying a specific data structure to solve a problem"]. The notebook explores a clean and readable solution.

Challenge 10: Apple (Level: Easy)
Problem: This Apple-themed problem is an accessible challenge for all skill levels. It focuses on [briefly describe the task, e.g., "calculating simple statistics," "string manipulation," or "looping through a list and performing an action"]. The solution is a straightforward implementation of the required logic.
